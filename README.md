# The official Plugin Released!

You can use the official built-in plugin ([Link](https://github.com/inkdropapp/inkdrop-import-markdown)) instead of this. Thank you.

# Import Markdown plugin

This plugin allows you to import notes from Markdown files.
It is a fork of the [import-html](https://github.com/inkdropapp/inkdrop-import-html) plugin.
